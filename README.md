The German "w" sounds like the English "v", and the German "v" sounds like the English "f". The Ö and Ü vowels are more difficult because they don't exist in English. To make the Ö sound, you can form the word "look" in your mouth, then purse your lips into an "O" shape. To make the Ü sound, you can start to make an "eww" sound, then purse your lips like you're going to whistle.

The German numbers from 1 to 10 become the building blocks for all larger numbers, so let’s take a moment to make sure we’re pronouncing them right. Since English is a Germanic language, there are lots of cognates and memory tricks you can lean on to help you remember the number names.

0 – Null

First, here’s a bonus number. Null means zero in German, which is very easy to remember from the English words ‘null’ and ‘nil’.

1 – Eins

Eins is not too different from its English equivalent, ‘one’ and rhymes with the English word ‘eye’. Since the German sound ei is used in the German numbers 1, 2, and 3, it makes a nice rhyme: Eins, zwei, drei.

Ein is also the only number in German that needs to be conjugated. Just like we use ‘one’ in English to mean ‘a’ or ‘an’, ein in German functions more as an adjective and changes based on the word it’s modifying. Depending on the gender and case, eins can take the variations ein, eine, einen, eines, einer, or einem.

2 – Zwei

‘Z’ in German makes a ‘ts’ sound, so you can remember that ‘two’ in German also starts with a ‘t’ sound.

3 – Drei

Drei in German sounds a lot like the English ‘dry’, except that it uses a softer, rolled ‘r’ sound.

4 – Vier

Since ‘v’ makes an ‘f’ sound in German, you can remember that this starts with the same sound as four in English. It’s also very close to the English word ‘fear’, with more breath when you pronounce the consonants.

5 – Fünf

Fünf starts with an ‘f’ sound just like the English ‘five’. Remember, the ü sound is pronounced like you’re saying ‘eww’ except with your mouth wider open.

6 – Sechs

Yes, this word sounds very close to a certain word in English — no further memory aid needed. The only difference is that the starting sound is more of a ‘z’ and you should roll the ‘ch’ in the back of your throat.

7 – Sieben

Sieben is close to the English ‘seven’, with a nice long vowel at the start: ZEE-ben.

8 – Acht

The easiest way to remember this number is that is sounds like the prefix oct- as in ‘octopus’ and ‘octogon’, meaning eight. The ‘ch’ sound is hard to master here, similar to a Scottish loch. Roll the sound in the back of your throat like you’re trying to clear something out of there—that’s it!

9 – Neun

While this looks and sounds a lot like the number nine, the middle vowels take a bit of practice. Pronounce neun just like the second syllable of the word ‘annoy’, capped off with another ‘n’ sound.

10 – Zehn

Zehn is pronounced ‘tsehn’ with a starting ‘t’ sound like the English ‘ten’. Make sure to stretch your vowel sound out, similar to the vowel sound in ‘gain’.

German numbers 11 to 20
Numeral	 German number	   Pronunciation
11	      elf	                ehlf
12	      zwölf	               tsvoolf
13	     dreizehn	          DRAI-tsehn
14	     vierzehn	          FEER-tsehn
15	     fünfzehn	          FOONF-tsehn
16	     sechzehn	          ZEHK-tsehn
17	      siebzehn	          ZEEB-tsehn
18	      achtzehn	           AHKT-tsehn
19	       neunzehn	           NOIN-tsehn
20	        zwanzig	            TVAN-tseeg
Let’s meet arguably the best two German numbers: elf and zwölf. These numbers remind most people of Lord of the Rings or other fantasy lore, with elves and wolves. Zwölf is fun to say once you get the hang of it: practice stringing all the sounds together slowly: ts-voo-lf.

Since you just learned zehn, prepare to use it a lot. Just like the -teen ending in English, German uses -zehn to cap off all numbers 13 through 19. Dreizehn, vierzehn, fünfzehn, you’ll soon get the pattern.

ein Meter = 1m
ein Zentimeter = 1cm
ein Meter fünfzehn = 1,15m
zweihundert Kilometer  = 2km
ein Quadratmeter  = 1m square of 2
